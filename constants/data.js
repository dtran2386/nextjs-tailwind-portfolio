      `My name is Dylan Tran and I've been coding for roughly 7 years, with 5 of those 7 being professional development in an agile setting.`,
      `My software development journey started in 2015 when I completed a 6 month JavaScript focused bootcamp. There I learned the basics of coding and front end development in general. Unfortunately back then coding bootcamps weren't held in high regard as they are now, so as you can imagine, I had a tough time trying to get a company to hire me. Nonetheless I couldn't give up, so I accepted a job as a QA analyst, and spent my nights honing my dev skills by working on personal projects. Fast forward 1 year later, I was able to convince a React + Node.js shop within the GIS division of Bank of America to take a chance on me, and the rest is history.`,
      `I typically code in React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Tailwind CSS. I also have experience on the DevOps side of the SDLC, particularly with Ansible, Ansible Tower, Jenkins, XL Release, and Red Hat Openshift.`,
